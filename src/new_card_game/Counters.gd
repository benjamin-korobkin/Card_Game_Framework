extends Counters

# * The `counters_container` has to point to the scene path, relative to your
#	counters scene, where each counter will be placed.
# * value_node specified the name of the label which holds
#	the value of the counter as displayed to the player
# * The needed_counters dictionary has one key per counter used in your game
#	Each value hold a dictionary with details about this counter.
#	* The key matching `value_node` will be used to set the starting
#		value of this counter
#	* All other keys specified have to match a label node name in the counter scene
#		and their value will be set as that label's text.
# * spawn_needed_counters() has to be called at the end, to actually
#	add the specified counters to your counters scene.
